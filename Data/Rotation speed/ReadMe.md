# Rotation Speed
Including the raw data of the Magbot experiments of rotation speed with the Magbot number = 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 19, 37, 61.
In each .mat file, the first row stores the background light intensities, and the second rows to the last rows store the rotation speeds (rpm) of different samples corresponding to different light intensities.
