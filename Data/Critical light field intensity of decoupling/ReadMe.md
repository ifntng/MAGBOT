# Critical light field intensity of decoupling
Including the raw data of the Magbot experiments of critical light field intensity of decoupling with the magnet height = 1, 1.5 mm.
In the CriticalLightFieldIntensityOfDecoupling.mat file, the first row stores the the magnet heights (mm), and the second rows to the last rows store the critical light field intensities of decoupling of different samples corresponding to different magnet heights.
