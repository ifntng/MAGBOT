# “Phase” diagram
Including the raw data of the Magbot experiments of “phase” diagram with different boundary diameters, Magbot numbers,  rotation speeds and magnetic forces.
Each .mat file is named by its boundary diameter, Magbot number, rotation speed, magnetic force and id.
In each .mat file, every cell stores the central position (x,y) (mm) of a Magbot, the rows correspond to different Magbots, and the columns corresponds to different time points with the interval = 1 s.
