# Adaptivity
Including the raw data of the Magbot experiments of adaptivity with initial length L = 37 cm, Magbot number N = 100,  rotation speed = 1.5 rps and magnetic force = 0.52 N.
In each .mat file, the first row stores the boundary states (0 means relaxed state, 1 means the compression process and -1 means the de-compression process), and other cells store the central positions (x,y) (mm) of Magbots, the second rows to the last rows correspond to different Magbots, and the columns corresponds to different time points with the interval = 1 s.
