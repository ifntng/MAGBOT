Including the raw data of the Magbot experiments of translational motion with the Magbot number = 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 19, 37, 61 at light intensity = 45.
In each .mat file, every cell stores the central position (x,y) (mm) of the sample, the rows correspond to different samples, and the columns corresponds to different time points with the interval = 1/30 s.
