# Structural self-optimization
Including the raw data of the Magbot experiments of structural self-optimization with boundary diameter D = 30 cm, Magbot number N = 70,  rotation speed changing from 0.7 rps to 2.2 rps to 0.7 rps, and magnetic force = 0.52 N.
In each .mat file, the first row stores the rotation speeds, and other cells store the central positions (x,y) (mm) of Magbots, the second rows to the last rows correspond to different Magbots, and the columns corresponds to different time points with the interval = 1 s.
