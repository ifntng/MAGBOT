# Magnetic binding force
Including the statistical data of the Magbot experiments of magnetic binding force with the magnet height = 1, 1.5, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 3 mm at gap diatance = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mm.
In the MagneticForce.mat file, the first row stores the gap distances (mm) of the magnets, the first column stores the magnet heights (mm), and the other cells store the magnetic forces [mean, standard deviation] (N) correspond to different magnet heights and different gap distances.
